### Generate Gifs!

#### How it works

* This simple page calls the [Giphy API](https://api.giphy.com/) to display 10 Gifs using the keyword(s) on the buttons along the top of the page.
* Add buttons by typing anything you'd like in the text box and clicking `boom`
* Click on individual Gifs to see them animate.  Click again to stop animation.
* Click on the top buttons multiple times to see new Gifs from the same keywords
* Clicking the `Surprise Me` button will give you 1 completely random GIF.
